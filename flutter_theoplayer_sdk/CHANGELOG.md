## 7.0.0

* Update THEOplayer to 7.0.0.

### Versioning changes
We are updating the version numbering for THEOplayer Flutter SDK to more closely match the underlying native THEOplayer SDKs.

Here are the notable changes:
- The **major** version will be matching the underlying native SDK major version.
- The **minor** version will reflect new features added in THEOplayer Flutter SDK.
- The **patch** version will be increased when there is a need for a hotfix on top of the minor version bump.

>Note: Breaking changes in THEOplayer Flutter SDK will only occur while increasing the **major** version.
